Basically all employees within Sitel potentially have access to the tool. But in order to access it, you would need a subscription provisioned for you. There are two types of subscriptions available, Free and Pro, both having their uses. If you would only want to view reports created by and shared by other employees published on our Premium capacity or create reports only viewable by yourself, a Free account is all you need. If you need to develop reports/dashboards that will be shared to other employees, or if you need to view reports created by another Pro user on a workspace not in the Premium capacity, a Pro account is what you need. This needs to be requested via ITSMC and would need approval from your direct supervisor as well as Director with justification."

That is achieving the highest rank 12 months out of the 12 months of 2021.

In school, I was typically one of the last ones to be picked for football or handball but I was quite good in Athletics and could run pretty fast though. I tried out various sports disciplines when I was younger like Field Hockey and Fencing but the only sport activity I stuck with through all the years was running. At the end 20th, I then decided to try running a marathon and managed to finish just slightly above the 4-hour mark. After that, I occasionally went for 10k races only until I turned 45. It was actually back then when I met my girlfriend that I first got exposed to the world of ultra-marathons. I remember mentioning I was ready to move up to longer distances which for me was 15-20km when she said that she was running more than 100km in the mountains. I couldn’t believe how that was even possible and I started to get interested…. I joined some of her shorter training runs increasing the distance step-by-step. We then signed up for a Marathon in Krakow in 2018 and after that, I gave it a try and signed up for the 40k distance of the Zugspitz Ultra Trail Race.
